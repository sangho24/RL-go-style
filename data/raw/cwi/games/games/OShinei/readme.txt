GoGoD mentiones the existence of a tournament called
新鋭トーナメント from 1950, earlier than other tournaments
with the same or similar names, and they call this tournament Old Shinei.
Here we follow this nomenclature.

GoGoD has no games, but knows about the finalists:

Term  Year   Winner          Score   Runner-up  
1    1950  Fujisawa Hideyuki  1-0  Yamabe Toshiro  
2    1950  Miwa Yoshiro       1-0  Shinohara Masami  
Ends

Here we have two (non-final) games.
